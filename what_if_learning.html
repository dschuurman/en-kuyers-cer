    <h1>"What If Learning" Teacher Resources</h1>
    <h3>Provided by the Kuyers Institute at Calvin University</h3>

    <p>
        "What If Learning" arises out of the Charis Project on spiritual and moral development in schools, which was based at the Stapleford Centre in the 1990s and out of more recent work on teaching and Christian practices based at the Kuyers Institute at Calvin
        University. It has been developed to support schools that aspire to offer a distinctively Christian teaching and learning experience.
